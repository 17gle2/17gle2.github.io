        <p>My name is Gregory Le and I'm a senior at La Quinta. In the future I <br>
        plan to go to college but I don't quite know what I will major in yet.<br>
        I enjoy physics and computer science, So I am looking forward to probably<br>
        majoring in something in that field. My dream would be to one day have my<br>
        house, I have always yearned for a house growing up. For fun I love to <br>
        hangout with my friends and go out. I love to be active and go to the gym.<br>
        My favorite thing about school is the people I have met and the relationships<br>
        I have developed with them. I look foward to knowing them for the rest of my life.</p>
